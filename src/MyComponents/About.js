            This is an about Todos-List..
            <p>When we try to keep too many things in our mind,
                 we end up forgetting some important things.
                 So, it’s always recommended to develop a habit of writing things and let our mind perform
                  other important functions.</p>

                  <p>We usually have many tasks 
                scheduled every day and keeping a track of them might be a tedious task.
                It lets you add tasks and create reminders easily. Todos-list shows an overlay of tasks daily 
                at the preferred time and you to prioritize items seamlessly.
                 So, sure you can’t forget important things.</p>
